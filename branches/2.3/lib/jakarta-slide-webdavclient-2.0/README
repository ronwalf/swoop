targets can be used:

- build-clientlib: Compile
- dist-clientlib: Build jar lib with WebDav client and copy required jars to build/lib
- javadoc-clientlib: Create API documentation
- build-cmd: Build commandline client
- dist-cmd: Distribute commandline client with required jars
- all: dist and javadoc are executed

Using client library

The class org.apache.webdav.lib.WebdavResource is the main interface
to the client. Usage examples can be found in the implementation of 
the command line client.
