Additional Considerations:

The Natural-Language renderer plugin included since Swoop v2.3 (beta 3) makes use of the QTag API (http://www.english.bham.ac.uk/staff/omason/software/qtag.html) developed by Oliver Mason. Under its license, you are not permitted to use QTag without Swoop, as it is restricted to non-commercial use by itself. Please contact the author (O.Mason@bham.ac.uk) for further details if you wish to use it independently.   

Swoop uses (and includes) many third party libraries.  See each library for appropriate redistribution terms.
